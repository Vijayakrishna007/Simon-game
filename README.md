# Simon-game
This is a basic Simon Game made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game tests your memory by showing a pattern of colors you need to repeat.

## How to Play
Press any key to start the game.<br>
The system will select and blink a color in white (e.g., Red button blinks white).<br>
Click the buttons to repeat the same pattern:<br>
<ul>
  <li>If you select the correct button, it will blink green.</li>
<li>
  If you select the wrong button, the game will end.
</li>
</ul>

With each correct round, the system will add one more color to the pattern.<br>
Try to remember and repeat the growing sequence!
